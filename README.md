#### Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

#### Deliverable 4: Design Proposal a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Lin_Reg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109227896/197421672-a81c0f91-7e6c-42ad-9609-e91e16a6e861.png)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. What this means is that vehicle length and ground clearance have a considerable impact on MPG.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a significant relationship between two independent variables, vehicle length and ground clearance, and the dependent variable - MPG.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The Multiple R-squared value is 0.7149. Therefore, the model predicts MPG of MechaCar effectively at a rate of approximately 71%.
